# ol-describe-map

The purpose of this library is to provide configurable means of getting a textual description of an OpenLayers map.

This description could enhance OpenLayers map applications by 
* providing additional information
* adding semantics
* making them more accessible (e.g. for visually impaired users)

The library ships with the most basic functionality to describe maps, which most applications will most likely adjust to their specific purpose. It is easy to configure more specific describers that take care of the specialties of your actual application.
